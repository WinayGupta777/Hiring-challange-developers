# C Programming Assignment: Text File Processor

## Overview
This assignment tests your understanding of fundamental C programming concepts including file I/O, memory management, and string manipulation.

## Task Description
Complete the implementation of a text file processor program by filling in the TODO sections in the provided template file (`text_processor_template.c`). The program should:
1. Count the number of words in the file
2. Find the longest word
3. Count the frequency of each word
4. Write the results to an output file

## Requirements
- The program should handle files of any size
- Memory should be managed efficiently
- The program should be robust and handle errors gracefully
- The code should be well-documented
- Complete all TODO sections in the template file

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (gcc recommended)
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Copy `text_processor_template.c` to `text_processor.c`
5. Implement the solution in `text_processor.c`
6. Compile the program using: `gcc -o text_processor text_processor.c`
7. Run the program: `./text_processor input.txt output.txt`

## Template Structure
The template file (`text_processor_template.c`) provides:
- Basic program structure
- Function prototypes
- Placeholder comments for implementation
- Variable declarations
- TODO markers indicating where code needs to be added

## Testing
Test your implementation with:
- Empty files
- Files with special characters
- Large files
- Files with different line endings
- The provided sample_input.txt

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code correctness
- Memory management
- Error handling
- Code organization and readability
- Documentation
- Performance considerations
- Completeness of implementation

## Submission
Submit your solution as a pull request with:
1. Your completed `text_processor.c` file
2. A brief explanation of your implementation approach
3. Any additional test cases you created
