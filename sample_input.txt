This is a sample text file for testing the text processor program.
It contains multiple lines and various words of different lengths.

Some words are repeated multiple times, like "test" and "program".
This helps in testing the word frequency counter.

Special characters: !@#$%^&*()
Numbers: 12345 67890

Empty lines should be handled properly.

The program should handle this file correctly and produce meaningful output.
